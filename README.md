# RayTracingInOneWeekend

My attempt at doing the 
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf)

More info at their [github repo](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io)


The idea is to do the book, but using Win32 Window as a renderer.
